   Configured the open source CMU Sphinx speech recognition toolkit. Used their adjustable, modifiable speech recognizer written in Java to handle the speech recognition and video transcription parts. Made appropriate use of their SphinxBase support library and the SphinxTrain acoustic model training libraries written in C to successfully train and adapt our own model on top of the existing English langauge model to minimize vast inaccuracies.
